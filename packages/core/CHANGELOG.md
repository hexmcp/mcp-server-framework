## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 3236625: Add comprehensive Error Mapper Middleware as outermost safety net

  This release introduces the Error Mapper Middleware, a production-ready error handling system that serves as the outermost layer in the middleware stack, ensuring all uncaught exceptions are properly converted to JSON-RPC 2.0 error responses.

  ## New Features

  ### Error Mapper Middleware

  - **Comprehensive Error Classification**: 13 different error types with appropriate JSON-RPC error codes
  - **Environment-Based Debug Mode**: Controlled by `MCPKIT_DEBUG=1` environment variable
  - **Structured Logging**: Rich logging with correlation IDs, request context, and metadata
  - **Production Safety**: No sensitive data leaks in production mode
  - **Custom Error Mapping**: Support for custom error mappers and hooks
  - **Built-in Integration**: Seamless integration with middleware builder pattern

  ### Error Classification System

  - `RPC_ERROR`: Pass-through for existing RpcError instances
  - `MIDDLEWARE_ERROR/MIDDLEWARE_TIMEOUT/REENTRANT_CALL`: Framework-specific errors (-32603)
  - `VALIDATION_ERROR`: Parameter validation failures (-32602)
  - `AUTHENTICATION_ERROR/AUTHORIZATION_ERROR`: Security-related errors (-32001)
  - `RATE_LIMIT_ERROR`: Rate limiting violations (-32002)
  - `TIMEOUT_ERROR/NETWORK_ERROR`: Infrastructure-related errors
  - `PARSE_ERROR`: JSON/syntax parsing failures (-32700)
  - `STANDARD_ERROR/UNKNOWN_ERROR`: Fallback classifications

  ### Factory Functions

  - `createErrorMapperMiddleware(options?)`: Main factory with comprehensive options
  - `createErrorMapperMiddlewareWithDefaults()`: Convenience factory with sensible defaults

  ### Built-in Middleware Support

  - `builtIn.errorMapper(options?)`: Fluent builder integration
  - `createBuiltInErrorMapperMiddleware(options?)`: Direct built-in middleware creation

  ## Usage Examples

  ### Basic Usage

  ```typescript
  import { createErrorMapperMiddleware } from "@hexmcp/core";

  // Register as first (outermost) middleware
  const errorMapper = createErrorMapperMiddleware({
    enableLogging: true,
    includeRequestContext: true,
  });
  middlewareRegistry.registerMiddleware(errorMapper);
  ```

  ### Production Configuration

  ```typescript
  const errorMapper = createErrorMapperMiddleware({
    debugMode: false,
    enableLogging: true,
    logLevel: "error",
    includeStackTrace: false,
    logger: productionLogger,
  });
  ```

  ### Development Configuration

  ```typescript
  const errorMapper = createErrorMapperMiddleware({
    debugMode: true,
    enableLogging: true,
    logLevel: "debug",
    includeStackTrace: true,
    includeRequestContext: true,
  });
  ```

  ### Custom Error Mapping

  ```typescript
  const errorMapper = createErrorMapperMiddleware({
    customErrorMapper: (error, ctx) => {
      if (error instanceof MyCustomError) {
        return {
          code: -32000,
          message: "Custom application error",
          data: { type: error.type },
        };
      }
      return null; // Fall back to default mapping
    },
  });
  ```

  ## Debug Mode

  Set `MCPKIT_DEBUG=1` to enable debug mode:

  - Error details included in responses
  - Stack traces available (if `includeStackTrace: true`)
  - Original error messages preserved
  - Additional metadata in structured logs

  ## Structured Logging

  Rich JSON-formatted logs with:

  - Error classification and severity
  - Request context (ID, method, transport)
  - Correlation IDs for distributed tracing
  - Environment metadata
  - Optional stack traces

  ## Breaking Changes

  None. This is a new feature that doesn't affect existing functionality.

  ## Migration Guide

  No migration required. The Error Mapper Middleware is opt-in and can be added to existing middleware stacks:

  ```typescript
  // Add as first middleware for comprehensive error handling
  middlewareRegistry.registerMiddleware(createErrorMapperMiddleware());
  // ... existing middleware
  ```

  Add comprehensive LRU (Least Recently Used) cache implementation with TTL (Time-To-Live) support for efficient resource caching in the MCP server framework.

  **New Features:**

  - `LruStore<K, V>` interface with O(1) operations (get, set, delete, has, clear)

  - Iterator support for keys and values with automatic expired item cleanup

  **Key Capabilities:**

  - **Efficient Performance**: O(1) core operations using Map insertion order manipulation
  - **Lazy TTL Expiration**: Items expire on access without background timers

  - **ResourceProvider Integration**: Drop-in replacement for resource caching in ResourceRegistry
  - **Configurable Options**: Capacity limits, default TTL, statistics collection, MIME types
  - **TypeScript Strict**: Full type safety with proper optional property handling

  **Usage Example:**

  ```typescript
  import { createLruResourceStore } from "@hexmcp/core/storage";

  // Create LRU cache with capacity and TTL
  const resourceCache = createLruResourceStore(100, 5 * 60 * 1000); // 5 minutes TTL

  // Use with ResourceRegistry
  registry.setResourceProvider("cached-resources", resourceCache);
  ```

  **Internal Module**: This is an internal storage module not exported in the public API, designed for use within the framework's resource management system.

  **Test Coverage**: 57 comprehensive tests with 92.59% coverage including performance benchmarking, memory leak prevention, and enterprise-grade stress testing.
