  - `MiddlewareExecutionOptions` - Configurable timeout and depth limits
  - `MiddlewareError`, `MiddlewareTimeoutError`, `ReentrantCallError` - Comprehensive error types

  ## üìä Quality Metrics

  ### Test Coverage

  - **92.08% statement coverage** (exceeds 80% requirement)
  - **331 passing tests** across 21 test suites
  - **Comprehensive test categories**: execution order, state mutation, short-circuit, error handling, integration

  import { McpMiddlewareEngine, McpMiddlewareRegistry } from "@hexmcp/core";

  const registry = new McpMiddlewareRegistry();
  const engine = new McpMiddlewareEngine();

  // Register middleware
  registry.registerMiddleware(authMiddleware);
  registry.registerMiddleware(loggingMiddleware);

  // Execute with infinite loop prevention
  await engine.executeMiddleware(ctx, registry.getMiddlewareStack(), {
    timeout: 10000, // 10 second timeout
    maxDepth: 50, // Maximum call depth
  });
  ```

  ```typescript
  import { McpMiddlewareBuilder } from "@hexmcp/core";

  const builder = new McpMiddlewareBuilder();
  builder.use(authMiddleware).use(loggingMiddleware).use(rateLimitMiddleware);
  ```

  ### Error Handling

  ```typescript
  try {
    await engine.executeMiddleware(ctx, middleware);
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof MiddlewareTimeoutError) {
      console.log("Middleware execution timed out");
    } else if (error instanceof ReentrantCallError) {
      console.log("Detected re-entrant middleware call");
    }
  }
