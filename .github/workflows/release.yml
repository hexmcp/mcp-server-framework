name: Release

# This workflow creates version bump pull requests when changes are pushed to main.
# It does NOT publish packages to npm automatically - publishing is disabled until MVP completion.
#
# Current behavior:
# 1. Runs quality checks (linting, type checking, tests)
# 2. Creates "Version Packages" pull requests with changelog updates
# 3. Auto-merge is handled by the dedicated auto-merge-version-pr.yml workflow
# 4. When version PR is merged, packages are versioned but NOT published
#
# To enable publishing after MVP completion:
# 1. Add NPM_TOKEN to repository secrets
# 2. Update the changesets action to include publish step
# 3. Update version-packages script to include publishing
